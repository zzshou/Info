Currently I am a Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk), in [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk), under supervision of [Prof. Lin Fangzhen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/flin). Before pursing my Ph.D, I obtained my MSc degree in Information Technology from HKUST and the bachelor degree in Information Security from [Central University of Finance and Economic (China)](https://en.cufe.edu.cn/index.htm).   
My research interests lie in the area of semantic representation, Abstract Meaning Representation, including parsing, generation and applications.
